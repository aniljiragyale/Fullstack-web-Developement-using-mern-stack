Here is a simple note on **Java** that you can use for your application:

### **Java Basics**

#### **What is Java?**
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is known for its platform independence, which means Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for building enterprise-level applications, web apps, mobile applications (Android), and much more.

#### **Core Concepts in Java:**

1. **Classes and Objects**:
   - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that an object will have.
   - **Object**: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity.

   Example:
   ```java
   class Car {
       String model;
       int year;

       void start() {
           System.out.println("The car is starting");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Car car1 = new Car();
           car1.model = "Tesla";
           car1.year = 2020;
           car1.start();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Data Types**:
   - **Primitive Data Types**: These are the most basic data types like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
   - **Non-Primitive Data Types**: These include objects and arrays, which are more complex structures.

   Example of primitive data types:
   ```java
   int age = 25;
   char gender = 'M';
   boolean isStudent = true;
   ```

3. **Control Flow Statements**:
   - **If-Else**: Used to perform conditional operations.
   - **Switch**: Used for decision-making based on multiple possible values of a variable.
   - **For/While Loop**: Used to execute a block of code multiple times.

   Example of a `switch` statement:
   ```java
   int day = 3;
   switch(day) {
       case 1: System.out.println("Monday");
               break;
       case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday");
               break;
       case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday");
               break;
       default: System.out.println("Invalid Day");
   }
   ```

4. **Methods**:
   - A method is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be called to perform an operation.
   - Methods can have parameters and return types.

   Example:
   ```java
   class MathOperations {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MathOperations mathOps = new MathOperations();
           int result = mathOps.add(5, 3);
           System.out.println("Result: " + result);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   Java follows OOP principles. The main pillars of OOP are:
   - **Encapsulation**: Wrapping of data (variables) and methods into a single unit called class. Access control (private, public) is used for hiding the internal workings.
   - **Inheritance**: The ability to create new classes from existing ones. A subclass inherits properties and methods from a superclass.
   - **Polymorphism**: The ability for different classes to provide a unique implementation of a method, even when the method signature is the same.
   - **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

   Example of inheritance:
   ```java
   class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Animal myDog = new Dog();
           myDog.sound();  // Outputs: Dog barks
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Arrays**:
   An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

   Example of using an array:
   ```java
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   System.out.println(numbers[2]);  // Output: 3
   ```

7. **Exception Handling**:
   Java provides a robust mechanism for handling errors through `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks. This ensures that your program doesn't crash unexpectedly and can handle exceptional conditions.

   Example:
   ```java
   try {
       int division = 10 / 0;  // Division by zero will cause an exception
   } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
       System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
   } finally {
       System.out.println("This will always run");
   }
   ```

8. **Java Collections Framework**:
   Java provides a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly used collection data structures such as lists, sets, and maps.
   - `List`: An ordered collection (e.g., `ArrayList`).
   - `Set`: A collection that does not allow duplicates (e.g., `HashSet`).
   - `Map`: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., `HashMap`).

   Example of using `ArrayList`:
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
           fruits.add("Apple");
           fruits.add("Banana");
           fruits.add("Orange");

           System.out.println(fruits);  // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
       }
   }
   ```

9. **Java 8 Features (Lambda Expressions, Streams)**:
   Java 8 introduced several powerful features, such as lambda expressions and streams, for more concise and functional programming.

   Example of a lambda expression:
   ```java
   interface Greeting {
       void greet(String name);
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Greeting greet = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
           greet.greet("John");
       }
   }
   ```
